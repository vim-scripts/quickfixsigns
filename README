Display |signs| at interesting lines:

    - items in the |quickfix| and |location-lists| (e.g. compilation errors)
    - |marks| a-zA-Z
    - changes (given the file is under a VCS like git, svn, mercurial, 
      or bazaar -- see |g:tlib#vcs#def| for a list of supported VCSs)
    - breakpoints: vim
    - cursor position
    - relative line numbers (show numbers only until the cursor moves; 
      this requires that you add the following command to |vimrc|:
        noremap <silent> <leader><c-l> :call quickfixsigns#RelNumbersOnce()<cr>
    - etc.

Other lists can be configured via the |g:quickfixsigns_lists| variable.

The text attached to a quickfix or location-list entry is displayed in a 
balloon via 'balloonexpr'.
NOTE: This could cause a conflict with other plugins that make use of 
balloons.

If you want nicer looking images instead of the ASCII markers, you have 
to change the following signs' definition either in your |vimrc| file or 
in $VIMFILES/after/plugin/quickfixsigns.vim (by use of |sign-define|):

    QFS_QFL ... Entries in the |quickfix| list
    QFS_LOC ... Entries in the |location-list|
    QFS_Mark_[a-zA-Z] ... Marks
    QFS_CURSOR ... Current cursor position
    QFS_BREAKPOINT ... Breakpoints
    QFS_REL_x ... Relative line numbers
    QFS_VCS_{ADD,DEL,CHANGE} ... VCS changes (see also 
            |g:quickfixsigns#vcsdiff#highlight|)
