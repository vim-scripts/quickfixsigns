Display |signs| at interesting lines:

    - items in the |quickfix| and |location-lists| (e.g. compilation errors)
    - |marks| a-zA-Z
    - changes (given the file is under a VCS like git, svn, mercurial, 
      or bazaar)
    - relative line numbers (show numbers only until the cursor moves)
    - etc.

Other lists can be configured via the |g:quickfixsigns_lists| variable.

The text attached to a quickfix or location-list entry is displayed in a 
balloon via 'balloonexpr'.
