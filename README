Mark intersting lines with signs:

    - items in the quickfix and location lists (e.g. compilation errors)
    - marks a-zA-Z
    - relative line numbers
    - changes (with respect to the version in the VCS)

Other lists can be configured via the |g:quickfixsigns_lists| variable.

The attached text is displayed in a balloon when hovering with the mouse 
over the sign.
