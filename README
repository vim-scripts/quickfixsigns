Mark items in the quickfix and location lists with signs -- those lists 
are filled by, e.g., the :make command. Other lists can be configured 
via the |g:quickfixsigns_lists| variable. By default, quickfixsigns also 
displays signs for the marks a-zA-Z.

The attached text is displayed in a balloon when hovering with the mouse 
over the sign.
